      </div>

        <h3> How the Web Works </h3>
        <p>
        The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em> HTTP Request </em> to a <em> server </em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em> web browser </em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> This video </a> does a good job of explaining more.

        <h3> HTML </h3>
        <p>
         HTML stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language </em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em> text content </em> which describes "what you see" and <em> markup </em> which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This video </a> gives a good overview.

        <h3> Tags and Elements </h3>
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML <b> elements </b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b> tags </b>.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> This video </a> explains the distinction well.

        <h3> Why Computers are Stupid </h3>
        <p>
         Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This mkaes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
       </p>

      <div>
        <h3> Inline vs Block Elements </h3>
       <p>
          HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> or <b> block </b>. <em> Block </em> elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. The box height and width can be changed.

       <h3> Developer Tools (in the Browser) </h3>
       <p>
          HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> or <b> block </b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
       </p>
     </div>

     <div>
        <h3> The "tree-like structure" of HTML </h3>
       <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... <br>
       In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h3> The relationship between indented HTML and boxes </h3>
        <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em> text </em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h3> Text Editors (for programming) </h3>
       <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tage when you write an opeing tag.

        <h3> Avoiding Repetition </h3>
        <p>
        Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons. <br>
        <b> Avoiding Errors: </b> When programmers <em> don't </em> aboid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't diligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise. <br>
        <b> Consistency: </b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <b> div </b> the same <b> class </b> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetition, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3> CSS </h3>
        <p>
         CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <b> class </b> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
